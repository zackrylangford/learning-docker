# Learning Docker

This repository contains my personal journey of learning Docker, an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization technology.

## Objective

The goal of this repository is to help me become proficient in using Docker for application development. I aim to understand how Docker can make the development process more efficient and consistent by creating isolated, controlled environments for running applications.

## Key Concepts

Throughout this journey, I am focusing on several key Docker concepts:

1. **Docker Images**: Lightweight, standalone, executable software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software.

2. **Docker Containers**: Runtime instances of Docker images, serving as the live application.

3. **Dockerfile**: The blueprint for creating Docker images.

4. **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

5. **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry service for sharing Docker images.

## Why Docker?

Docker allows developers to "build once, run anywhere", ensuring that applications and their dependencies can be bundled into a single container to run on any server. This solves the common problem of "it works on my machine" and enables faster, more efficient build and deployment processes.

## Current Progress

As of now, I've spent time understanding the basics of Docker and its core concepts. The next steps in my learning journey will involve practical application and deeper exploration of advanced Docker functionalities.

## Resources

I have been using various resources for learning Docker, including the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/), Q&A sessions with AI assistants, and online tutorials.
