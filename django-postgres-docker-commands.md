Absolutely, here's a basic list of Docker and Docker Compose commands that you might find useful while managing a Django application with PostgreSQL. 

1. **Building services**
```bash
docker-compose build
```
This command is used to build the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

2. **Starting services**
```bash
docker-compose up
```
This command starts the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Running a command inside a service**
```bash
docker-compose exec service_name command
```
This command is used to execute a command inside a running service. For example, to run Django migrations, you would use:

```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

4. **Stopping services**
```bash
docker-compose down
```
This command is used to stop running services.

5. **View running services**
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
This command is used to view the currently running services.

6. **Rebuilding a service**
```bash
docker-compose up --build service_name
```
This command is used to rebuild a specific service.

7. **Checking logs**
```bash
docker-compose logs
```
This command is used to view the logs of your services.

8. **Creating a superuser for Django**
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```
This command creates a superuser for your Django application.

9. **Collect static files**
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic
```
This command is used to collect static files in your Django application.

Remember to replace `service_name` with the actual name of the service where you want to run the command (like `web` for your Django app). 

These are some basic commands to start with. As you get more comfortable with Docker and Docker Compose, you might find yourself using more advanced commands or options, but this should serve as a good reference for the basics.
